Did Pseudocode with Seth Donohue and included photo of both of our attempts at this.  We both connected on the solution.

Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.

The output should be two capital letters with a dot seperating them.

It should look like this:

Sam Harris => S.H

Patrick Feeney => P.F
